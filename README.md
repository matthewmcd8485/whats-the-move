Use wtm? to make plans with people without having to send individual text messages to everyone.


How do I use this?
1. Create your profile, complete with a picture and current status
2. Add friends by phone number or import from contacts
3. Put friends into groups with unique names
4. Send bored "requests" to individual groups or to everyone
5. Respond to requests by saying if you're free or not
